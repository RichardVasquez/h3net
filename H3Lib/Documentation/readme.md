# Documentation

Read [the auto generated docs](H3Lib.md)

While this is still being built, I'm running an auto
build of documentation.  Later, I'll clean it up, but
this will give you an idea as to where it's at, at any
given moment.

Currently, this is using XML-Documentation that gets
turned into one big XML file, then it's auto converted
to a MarkDown file via
[lijunle/Vsxmd](https://github.com/lijunle/Vsxmd)

Later in the project, I'll start editing the structure
of that into bite sized chunks.
